# EDP-en-Finance
Homeworks and final project done in the class "EDP en Finance" from M2MO (ex DEA Laure Elie) program at  Universit√© de Paris. 

The 1-st homework is about pricing european put options using iplicit, explicit and Cranck-Nicolson schemes and then some basic analysis of the speed of convergence.
The 2-homework is about pricing american put options using splitting schemes (iplicit, explicit and Cranck-Nicolson), and then using different methods for the obstacle problem: PSOR, relaxed PSOR, Newton, Brennan and Schwartz and one higher order splitting scheme.
The final project ("Numerical methods for impulse control problem") is based on the chapter 7 of the paper C. Reisinger, Y. Zhang, "Error estimates of penalty schemes for quasi-variational inequalities arising from impulse control problems", [arXiv:1901.07841v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07841).
